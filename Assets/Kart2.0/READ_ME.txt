Version 2.0! Everything is pretty much the same as before except I am trying a non
UV based material system for simplicity and ease of use. While this can make 
performace slower, I don't forsee it causing any issues.

When you want to make your custom colored kart, you can just create separate
materials in Unity of each color you want. Just drag and drop the materials onto the
color you want to replace.If you want it to be shiny (hope I'm not over-explaining) 
just change the metallic slider in your material in Unity. If we go with cel/toon 
shading (up to Hannah, I think) then there is also a slot for that in the shader asset
I have included in this package. You can also find different patterns and generate normal
maps online.

Places on kart where materials can be replaced (potential for 14 different ones!):
- exhaust pipes
- inside of exhaust pipes
- tires
- tire walls
- hub caps
- side blocks
- flares behind front wheels
- hood area
- logo area (hood)
- back design
- axles
- leg area
- seat
- steering wheel

Also, all of the character's colors can be replaced! To see the character in the right
place, you must press play first.

Things I'm still exploring:
* Scrolling texture capability to fake wheel spinning animation

Let me know about any issues or requests for the next version!
